# Basic Python Projects

This repository contains three simple Python projects that are great for beginners to practice their programming skills. 


## Project 1: 
Blackjack Capstone Game In this project, you'll find a classic Blackjack card game implemented in Python. This game allows players to play against the computer and experience the excitement of the casino right from their terminal. 

## Project 2: 
Hangman Game Hangman is a popular word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. This project provides a fun and interactive way to practice your string manipulation and conditional statement skills. 

## Project 3: 
Coffee Machine using OOPs Concept Ever wondered how a coffee vending machine works behind the scenes? In this project, you'll explore the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating a virtual coffee machine that can dispense different types of coffee based on user input. Feel free to explore each project's directory for detailed explanations, code implementations, and examples. 


These projects are designed to help you grasp fundamental concepts and enhance your coding abilities in Python. Happy coding! ðŸš€
