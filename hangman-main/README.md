# hangman
A Hangman game using basic Python
The hangman_word files contain list of words that are used for the game.
I've used the random module to choose a random word from the list.
It prints the number of blanks which is equal to number of letter of the randomly chosen word.
The program asks user to guess the word letter by letter.
User gets 6 lives in the beginning.
If guess is correct the letter will be placed at its position but if its incorrect you lose one life.
Happy guessing
